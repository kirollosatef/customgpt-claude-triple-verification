CORRECTNESS: Does the implementation actually solve the problem? Any logical errors?\n4. SECURITY: Any hardcoded secrets, injection risks, or unsafe patterns?\n5. TESTS: If tests were expected, did you write or verify them?\n\nIf ANY check fails, continue working — do NOT present incomplete work as finished.\nIf all checks pass, proceed with your response."
